Collection of some of my solutions of competitive programming tasks in C++ from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/MPeros).
All of my submission can be found [here](https://codeforces.com/submissions/MPeros).

Competitive programming contest usually lasts between 2 and 3 hours and has between 5 and 8 tasks where each tasks solution is significantly more difficult to think of and code then the last one. Therefore, problem A is usually something that is solved with ease while problem D or E is something very difficult. The winner of the contest is a competitor who solves most tasks in least amount of time. More about the rules can be seen [here](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/4088). 

Since speed is of the essence the code displayed here is often very messy. The contest that isn't solved in real time (such as Dynamic Programming Contest (AtCoder)) usually has much cleaner and well-written code.
